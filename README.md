# Machine_learning_project
The project uses machine learning tools to predict home prices in Ames, Iowa using a dataset from Kaggle.  The objective of the project is to predict, identify, and implement the best machine learning models in determining the value of a house.  We aim to identify the most important factors in purchasing a home to assist sellers and buyers.

Project scope encompassed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, linear regression models (multiple linear regression, lasso regularization), and tree-based models (random forest, gradient boosting).
